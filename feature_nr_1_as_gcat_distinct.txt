sql list:
'V','N','A','Adv','PropN','Prep','Part','Pron','Det','I','Conj','Punct','Comp','G'

after adjustment, the complete list is (description is taken from the documentation of XTAG):
V		Verb
N		Noun
A		Adjective
Adv		Adverb
PropN	Proper Noun -ignore for now
Prep	Preposition
Part	Verb Particle
Pron	Pronoun
Det		Determiner
I		Interjection
Conj	Conjunction
NVC		Noun/Verb Contraction
VVC		Verb/Verb Contraction -> may've, might've, etc.
Punct	Punctuation
Comp	Complementizer
G		->only the word "yours" and the genitive "'s" appears in the db with this at feature_nr=1
		so probably a mistake as 'yours' also appears correctly as pronoun with the GEN feature together 

note:
-proper names, pronouns (including it, that, there) and wh questioning words are present with some clitics (') as well like "who'd"
-nouns in engmorph.db are present with their (term)'s (3sg GEN) and (term)s'+(term)s's (3pl GEN) forms as well just
like in case of their nominative 3sg (term) and 3pl (term)s forms
-verbs are present in engmorph.db with their simple past (-ed) forms
-verbs are present in engmorph.db with their gerund (-ing) forms
-adjectives are present in engmorph.db with their comparative (-er) and superlative (-est) forms
-adverbs formed from adjectives are alse present with -ly ending:
https://www.ef.com/wwen/english-resources/english-grammar/forming-adverbs-adjectives/
Adverbs cannot always be formed from adjectives: fast as adjective+ly does not yield fastly as adverb
!!!Put adverbs ending in -ly as they are to the lexc file!!!
-!!!Put adjectives with -ic/-ical endings as well into lexc as there's no consistent rule for them!!! 
-!!!Watch out for entries with "Punct" feature!!!:
select * from morphology where feature='Punct';
-!!!TODO: think over to get rid of entries of two wordforms: -ses and -ses's!!!
select * from morphology where wordform like '-%' and feature_nr=1;
-!!!add rule to Vinf to exclude e.g. 'haves'

interesting, about singular aux for plural nouns like 'apples is...':
